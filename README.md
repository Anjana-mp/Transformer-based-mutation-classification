# Transformer-based models for uncovering genetic mutations in cancerous and non-cancerous genomes
## Overview  
This project focuses on **mutation classification** using **DNABERT 2** and **Nucleotide Transformer** models. It processes DNA sequences and classifies mutations efficiently. The paper is available at Transformer-based models for uncovering genetic mutations in cancerous and non-cancerous genomes. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2025.149460

## Installation  
To set up the required dependencies, run:  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Datasets
The following datasets are included in the project:

* Gen Sample.csv
* Gen Sample 2.csv
* Generated Sample.csv (a sample file for reference)

## Usage
To run the mutation classification code, execute:
```bash
python DNABERT 2 Classification.py
